                    DON'T BE A DICK EMAIL GUIDELINES LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CONTACTING AN EXTERNAL ENTITY VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL

  1. Send the damn email, just don't be a dick.
     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

     1a. Extreme profanity - any use of profanity, bar appropriate use in quotes
         or as an emphasising adverb not directed toward the negative
         description of an individual or corporation, are prohibited.
     1b. Using a subject line that is unrelated to the content.
     1c. Using an email provider that inserts advertising into your outgoing
         email. If you use Hotmail, you are a right dick.
     1d. Not using the correct language and grammar to the best of your ability.
         If you leave the CAPSLOCK on, you are a PROPER dick; it should only be
         used for word emphasis in plain text emails - if in doubt, use
         Markdown.
     1e. Sending unnecessary or uncompressed media via attachments, especially
         if that media is unnecessarily included in the body of the message.

  2. Do not use an email address for anything but it's intended purpose.

     2a. Do not harvest an email address for later use without having an
         intended later use.
     2b. Do not use the email address as a recipient for marketing, advertising
         or promotional use.
     2c. Do not distribute an email address to others if it has not already been
         made public.

  3. Do not help the association of the email address, in any way, to the
     sending and/or recieving of spam. If you do this, or are the cause of this,
     you are a DONKEY dick.

  3. If conditions one (1) or two (2) are broken, do not expect a reply.

  4. If you continue to break conditions one (1) or two (2), expect karma to get
     you. Or your mail server.
